Stony Brook Python Script!
Author : Danny Rodrigues


This is a scripting language written in python that uses the TPG parser to create an abstract syntax tree for semantic evaluation. 

How to Run :
Using python interpreter run as so : "python pythonscript.py input.txt"

Input.txt contains a python-like language, except that blocks are seperated by braces {} and not tabs. 


TODO : Update so it is compatible with Python 3.0, currently works on 2.7 and earlier
